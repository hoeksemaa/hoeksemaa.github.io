/* Where the signal comes from, and the only figure in the series that is a diagram
 * rather than a trace.
 *
 * THE EYE IS A BATTERY. The retinal pigment epithelium holds a standing potential
 * across the globe — cornea POSITIVE, retina negative, a few hundred µV to a
 * millivolt end to end. It is always there; nothing about a saccade creates it. All
 * a saccade does is ROTATE it.
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY THE SIGNS ONLY APPEAR AS THE EYES TURN. Looking straight at the
 * viewer the dipole points along the line of sight, so both poles project to the
 * same spot on screen and both canthi sit equidistant from it — the battery is
 * there and the difference it produces is zero. Rotating it swings the positive
 * pole toward one canthus and the negative pole toward the other, and only then is
 * there anything to measure. The signs fading in with the rotation is that, not a
 * charge appearing out of nothing.
 *
 * VERIFIED AGAINST THE RECORDING, which is the one thing here that is not a
 * drawing. Averaged over the cued glances: a LEFT cue puts ch_L at +39.0 µV and
 * ch_R at −25.4 µV; a RIGHT cue puts ch_R at +29.6 µV and ch_L at −34.2 µV. So
 * R − L is −64 µV one way and +64 µV the other, symmetric to within a microvolt,
 * and the canthus the cornea swings toward is the one that goes positive. The
 * geometry drawn here predicts that sign, and the data confirms it.
 *
 * HANDEDNESS, and it is worth being explicit because it is easy to get backwards.
 * These are eyes looking OUT at the reader, so screen-left is the subject's RIGHT.
 * GAZE_DIR = −1 sweeps the pupils to screen-left, which is the subject glancing to
 * their own right, and by the numbers above that drives R − L POSITIVE. Flip
 * GAZE_DIR to +1 and it becomes a leftward glance, matching the "look left" cue
 * guides in figures 2 onward. No electrodes are drawn: this figure is the source,
 * and where the signal gets measured from is figure 2's business.
 *
 * NO AXIS LINE BETWEEN THE POLES. It was drawn and cut: through a globe that is
 * itself outlined in grey, a third horizontal line reads as anatomy the eye does
 * not have. The two signs moving apart in step already say they are one object.
 *
 * THE SIGNS SIT OUTSIDE THE GLOBES, which is a legibility choice and not a
 * projection. The true poles stay inside the outline — at 30° they are only
 * Rg·sin 30° = 22 px off centre against a 44 px radius — so drawn faithfully they
 * would sit on top of the iris. They are pushed out to the rim along the same axis
 * and in the same proportion, so the direction and the ordering are honest even

/* ── 02 · measured against SRB1 ──────────────────────────────────────────── */

/* The step that makes a measurement exist at all.
 *
 * There is no such thing as the voltage AT a point — only the voltage BETWEEN
 * two. Every channel on this rig is one canthus measured against the reference
 * earlobe, and this figure is that subtraction. Before it, each amplifier pin
 * sits at whatever the body sits at; after it, there is a signal.
 *
 * Same invented open-loop scenario as figure 3, sharing every parameter, so the
 * arithmetic closes exactly:
 *
 *     V_pin_i = V_cm·(1 − Z_i/Z_in)    + true_i
 *     V_srb1  = V_cm·(1 − Z_srb1/Z_in)
 *     V_pin_i − V_srb1 = V_cm·(Z_srb1 − Z_i)/Z_in + true_i
 *
 * — and that last line IS figure 3's opening trace. So this figure opens on
 * `figure 3's opening trace + V_srb1` and the toggle removes V_srb1, landing on
 * figure 3 with nothing left over.
 *
 * THREE PANELS, figure 6's structure: the operands are drawn, then the result.
 * R and L are the two canthi as their amplifier pins see them; SRB1 is the
 * reference earlobe, drawn as its own trace because a subtraction whose subtrahend
 * is invisible is not a subtraction the reader can follow. It is the one figure in
 * the series taller than figure 6 — three 150 px panels instead of two — and the
 * top two sit at exactly figure 3's y, so the seam holds and only the canvas grows.
 *
 * SRB1 IS DRAWN IN RED, with the results it produces. Red is this series' colour
 * for what a step contributes, and the subtrahend and the two differences it makes
 * are one operation — so the reference, its two travelling copies and both output
 * traces are all the same colour. It also carries no biopotential and no drift,
 * only the common-mode, which is exactly why subtracting it takes the one and
 * leaves the other.
 *
 * THE REFERENCE SITS BETWEEN THE TWO CHANNELS, and doubles. One earlobe is
 * subtracted from two canthi, so its trace leaves the middle panel as TWO copies
 * that slide out in opposite directions — up into R, down into L — and dissolve as
 * they land. Putting it in the middle is what makes "at the same time" literal:
 * the distances are equal, so one progress variable gives both copies the same
 * speed AND the same arrival. Everything they overlay is at the same volts scale on
 * the way, and at that scale a channel and the reference agree to 0.013 %, so each
 * copy lands directly on top of the trace it is cancelling.
 *
 * L THEN CLOSES THE GAP. Once the reference is spent its panel is dead space, so L
 * rises into it and the figure finishes as the two panels figure 5 opens on, in
 * figure 5's own positions. Figure 6 converges two panels into one for the same
 * reason: a panel that has done its work should not go on occupying the page.
 *
 * TWO STAGES ON ONE CLICK, because "it all goes away" and "no, look closer, it
 * didn't" are two different claims and the second is the interesting one.
 *
 *   stage 1  subtract the reference. Its copies slide out into the two channels,
 *            its own panel empties and L closes the gap, and the axis HOLDS at the
 *            volts scale — so both channels collapse from a 3 V band of mains to a
 *            hairline on zero.
 *   stage 2  the axis zooms ~2000x, and the hairline turns out to have structure
 *            — the 392 µV and 168 µV that survived because the bridge is
 *            unbalanced. Subtraction gets you to a floor; it does not get you to
 *            zero. Figure 3 then lowers the floor.
 *
 * The zoom is LOGARITHMIC. A linear ramp from 3.73 V to 1550 µV spends 99 % of
 * its second above 40 mV and then snaps through the last three decades; equal
 * ratios per unit time is what reads as a steady zoom.
 *
 * AT THE VOLTS SCALE ALL THREE TRACES ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE. The channels differ
 * from the reference by ~400 µV out of 3 V — 0.013 % — so the figure opens on
 * three panels that look like the same trace, and that trace looks like mains.
 * That is the point: the eye signal is in there, four decades down, and nothing
 * about the raw pin potentials hints at it.
 *
 * THE NAMES CHANGE WITH THE ARITHMETIC, as figure 6's do when its R and L become
 * R − L: R and L are what went in, R−SRB1 and L−SRB1 are what came out, switching
 * on the subtraction itself so the name and the contents change together.
 *
 * NAMES AT THE SERIES' 15 px, like every other figure. "R−SRB1" measures to x=60
 * against tick labels that start at x=63, so it fits where a longer form would not:
 * the tick gutter is 108 px with the labels right-aligned into it, and anything
 * past x=63 lands on top of "−12.50".
 *
 * THE HALF-CELLS ARE NOT SPOOFED. V_srb1 carries the earlobe's own half-cell
 * potential too, but the recording's DC offsets — −11.1 mV on R, −38.9 mV on L —
 * already ARE (electrode half-cell − earlobe half-cell). Adding the earlobe's
 * offset to both channels and subtracting it again is a no-op, so what is
 * subtracted here is the common-mode alone. */

/* ── 03 · bias driven into the body ──────────────────────────────────────── */

/* Active cancellation, and the only figure in the series built on invented
 * numbers.
 *
 * WHY IT HAS TO BE INVENTED. The recording only ever contains SRB1-referenced,
 * bias-ON channels; the corpus has no PD_BIAS-off session, so the common-mode the
 * loop suppresses was never measured. Everything from figure 5 down is the
 * committed recording and this is not. What makes it honest anyway is that the
 * model is an INVERTIBLE function of the real data: the figure adds a leak term
 * and the toggle takes it back out, so at s=1 the trace is the recording bit for
 * bit. meta.bias carries every parameter, flagged `invented: true`.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM, which is not what most people expect. Bias does not subtract
 * anything from the measurement. Electrode impedances and the amplifier's input
 * impedance form a BRIDGE, and common-mode leaks into the difference in
 * proportion to how unbalanced that bridge is:
 *
 *     ch_i = ch_i_true + V_cm · (Z_srb1 − Z_i) / Z_in
 *
 * The loop drives an inverted copy of V_cm back into the BODY, which shrinks the
 * multiplier on that whole term. Sound-cancelling headphones, except the
 * anti-signal goes into the medium every microphone is sitting in rather than
 * into one pair of ears — which is exactly why one electrode on one earlobe helps
 * both channels at once. Not finite CMRR: the ADS1299's is −110 dB, far too good
 * to explain any visible hum.
 *
 * Z_in IS NOT THE CHIP. Its input impedance is gigaohms and irrelevant at 60 Hz.
 * The bottom of the bridge is the capacitance from each input node to ground,
 * dominated by unshielded electrode leads — 100 pF is 26.5 MΩ at 60 Hz.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FIGURE DOES NOT CLAIM. That the 60 Hz left in the recording is what
 * bias left behind. With the loop closed this model leaks 1.7–4 µV, and the
 * measured hum is several times that, 4× larger on R than on L, and correlated
 * between the channels at only +0.24 — none of which looks like a shared
 * common-mode. Lead-loop magnetic pickup is differential by cable geometry and
 * immune to both bias and CMRR. So the figure shows what bias REMOVES and says
 * nothing about the composition of what remains.
 *
 * THREE PANELS, LIKE FIGURE 2, and for the same reason: the anti-signal the loop
 * drives into the body sits BETWEEN the two channels and doubles, sliding up into R
 * and down into L over equal distances. Drawn in red with the results it produces,
 * since the anti-signal and the two suppressions it causes are one operation. Once
 * it is spent L closes the gap, and the figure finishes as figure 5's two panels in
 * figure 5's positions.
 *
 * ONE LOOP CANNOT NULL TWO CHANNELS EXACTLY. The two canthi sit behind different
 * mismatches, so the amount cancelled differs — 392 µV on R against 168 µV on L.
 * The middle panel is drawn at the mean of the two, and the ARITHMETIC applied to
 * each channel stays per-channel exact; only the display trace is averaged. What
 * that per-channel difference leaves behind is the (Z_L − Z_R) term figure 6 spends.
 *
 * SEAM. At s=1 this is figure 5's opening frame — same two panels, same baked
 * 3 s spans, same window-mean centring, same 1 s-per-second scroll. The toggle
 * runs BACKWARDS relative to the other figures for once: 0 is the loop open,
 * which is the state the reader arrives from, and 1 is the real recording. Black
 * and green go in, red comes out, on the same s as the arithmetic — figure 7's
 * contract. */

/* ── 05 · digitized ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/* The ADC: the hinge of the whole essay. Everything above this figure is
 * analogue physics reconstructed backwards; everything below it is arithmetic on
 * an array, and this is where the array first exists.
 *
 * THE RATE IS WRONG ON PURPOSE, and it is the one deliberate lie in the series.
 * The board runs at 250 Hz, so the 2 s window holds 500 samples per channel —
 * well over one per pixel. Drawn as dots they merge back into the line they came
 * from and the reader learns only that a trace is made of ink. So the figure
 * samples at 10 Hz instead: one dot per 100 ms, each the mean of 25 real samples.
 * What survives the exaggeration is the only thing this step has to teach — that
 * a continuous quantity has been replaced by one number per interval, and the
 * intervals are all there is from here on. meta.digitize carries both rates so
 * the prose can say which it is showing.
 *
 * ONE NUMBER PER INTERVAL, and the number is the interval's mean. Which makes
 * each band the whole truth about where its dot came from — the point of drawing
 * the band at all. The real converter does NOT do this: an ADS1299 decimates
 * with a third-order sinc, so a sample is a bell-weighted mean 3 output periods
 * wide whose centre of mass sits 1.5 periods behind the timestamp it is reported
 * under, and consecutive samples overlap three deep. A one-slot band would lie
 * about that. meta.digitize.adc carries the real filter — support, group delay,
 * -3 dB corner, all derived from f_CLK and the decimation ratio in the bake —
 * for prose that wants to name the gap. See adc_chain() there.
 *
 * THE CAMERA DOES NOT MOVE. Same 3 s window, same span, same scroll rate at both
 * ends of the toggle, so the only thing the control changes is the sampling. An
 * earlier cut opened on figure 6's 10 s frame and zoomed in as the dots appeared,
 * which made the seam exact but moved the camera and the operator together — and
 * a reader watching the picture change cannot then tell which of the two did it.
 * The cost is the seam: figure 6 opens five times wider, so the step from 5 to 6
 * is a zoom-out this figure no longer performs.
 *
 * COLOUR. Black and green are the two channels going in, red is the samples
 * coming out — one panel each, so the two red series are told apart by position
 * rather than by hue. The continuous traces do not morph toward red the way
 * figure 7's does: the dots REPLACE the curve rather than being the curve
 * transformed, and keeping R and L in their own colours is what lets a reader
 * follow which is which while both are on screen.
 *
 * ORDER OF APPEARANCE. Slots, then the samples that land in them, and only then
 * does the curve leave. A reader shown the dots before the intervals has no
 * reason to believe one-dot-per-interval is what happened rather than a
 * thinning-out of the line. */

 * the poll delivers. live_detrend() reproduces that poll by poll, verified
 * sample-for-sample against the BrainFlow call.
 *
 * No text on the figure. It is read inline beside the prose that explains it,
 * so anything the sentence next to it already says is ink competing with the
 * trace.
 *
 * SEAM. At s=0 this is figure 6's closing panel — same signal, same span, same
 * centring rule — so the toggle is the only thing that moves. Every figure
 * opens where the last one closed. The one thing that does change at the seam
 * is the colour: figure 6's output is red, and arriving here the same array is
 * this figure's input, so it is black.
 *
 * MOTION. The trace stretches slowly; the axis chases it. Centre and gridline

 *
 * Black in, red out, on the same s as the arithmetic — the same contract as
 * every other figure.
 *
 * THREE INDEPENDENT SLIDERS, one per filter, so any SUBSET of the chain can be
 * seen — low-pass and notch without the high-pass, notch alone, and so on. That
 * is exact rather than approximate. The filters are linear and commute, so
 *
 *   ∏ᵢ[(1−sᵢ)·I + sᵢ·Hᵢ] = Σ_S (∏_{i∈S} sᵢ)(∏_{i∉S}(1−sᵢ)) · ∏_{i∈S} Hᵢ
 *
 * — a multilinear interpolation of the eight subset outputs, all of which are
 * baked. Every slider position is therefore a filter the pipeline could have
 * run, not a crossfade between two pictures, and the corners of the cube are
 * the real thing.
 *
 * The corners are the ESSAY's, not the game's: low-pass 100 Hz, high-pass
 * 0.5 Hz, 4th order throughout, against the game's 30 / 0.1 and a 3rd-order
 * notch. 100 Hz is what keeps mains inside the passband, so the notch has
 * something visible to take out; at the game's 30 Hz corner both notch bands
 * sit above the low-pass and the toggle moves the trace a quarter of a pixel.
 * The chain is applied the way the game applies it — per 100 ms poll, to the
 * 125-sample buffer, IIR state starting from zero each time — so what diverges
 * is the numbers, deliberately, and nothing else. meta.game_filters carries the
 * real ones for prose that wants to name the difference.
 *
 * The axis is absolute — no window re-centring — so a gridline reading 0.00 mV
 * is 0 µV. That is only affordable because every subset here already starts
 * from figure 7's detrended array. */

 * game's filtered amplitude, and the same chain's velocity — rows 2 and 3
 * diverge only at the final step, and each carries its own ±6σ threshold from
 * the recording's own 5 s calibration. No control: the loop is the animation
 * (figure 9's precedent), and the argument is the comparison itself.
 *
 * TWO DELIBERATE DEPARTURES from the rest of the series, both the point:
 *
 * - THE GAME'S CORNERS, not the essay's. The data is baked through
 *   eog_core._eog_filter verbatim (LP 30 / HP 0.1, notch 3rd order). At the
 *   essay's LP 100 the derivative amplifies 40-100 Hz broadband so much that
 *   velocity LOSES on the 12-recording corpus (531/960 cued glances vs
 *   amplitude's 708/960 at 6σ) — PR #36's own "velocity performs best at
 *   ~35 Hz" warning, measured. At these corners: amplitude 526/960,
 *   velocity 926/960.
 *
 * - NOT the committed john recording. On john both rows catch 79/80 — the one
 *   subject in the corpus where nothing separates them. David (run #3 of the
 *   mass collection) is the honest witness: BOTH rows draw their σ from the
 *   same noisy opening — each lands at the 100th percentile of its own
 *   recording's 5 s blocks (σ_amp 51.3 µV vs blockwise median 14.9; σ_vel
 *   586.6 µV/s vs median 324) — so each detector gets the worst calibration
 *   it could have drawn. Amplitude's 6σ (±308 µV) sits ABOVE the recording's
 *   peak (265 µV): it cannot fire at all, 0/80 cued glances. Velocity's
 *   slimmer margin (peaks 2.2× its 6σ) still clears: 77/80. The bake
 *   (scripts/bake_ampvel_figure.py) carries the full numbers.
 *
 * Row names sit in the gutter per figures 2/3, but stacked at 10.5 px over
 * their band (label2) — "amplitude" at the standard 15 px would cross x=63
 * into the tick labels. Thresholds are figure 10's idiom: 1 px red rules,

/* ── 09 · calibrate → σ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/* What `_run_eog_sm` does in CALIBRATING, and the one number the next step needs.
 *
 * The trace is figure 8's output, unchanged — the same `lp_notch_hp` array it
 * ends on, in µV — and σ is the MAD of that. The live detector calibrates on
 * the VELOCITY instead (`_poll_eog` returns `_eog_velocity(filtered)[-n_new:]`,
 * so its σ is 342 µV/s), and the essay deliberately does not: keeping one
 * quantity and one unit the whole way down is worth more here than matching a
 * derivative the reader has not been shown. meta.calib.sigma_velocity carries
 * the detector's real number for prose that wants to name the gap.
 *
 * NO CONTROL. The loop is the animation. It runs the recording forward from
 * t=0 the way the board delivers it: a play-head advances in real time, the
 * window follows it once the recording is longer than the window, and every
 * 0.1 s a poll lands and σ is recomputed from everything counted so far. There
 * is nothing for a reader to toggle, so there is no toggle.
 *
 * The grey is anchored in RECORDING time, not screen position — it starts where
 * counting starts and ends at the play-head, so it travels with the samples it
 * marks rather than sitting still while they slide underneath.
 *
 * Black is the signal; red is the part of it that has been counted, tracking
 * the leading edge of the grey window, plus σ itself. The number earns its ink
 * under the rule the rest of the figures follow: it is a value this step
 * produces and the next step consumes, and no trace can show it.
 *
 * ONE DEPARTURE FROM THE CODE, deliberate and worth knowing. The state machine

/* The last step: turn a signal into events by drawing a line across it.
 *
 * The rule is `_sustained_crossing`'s own — |x| over k·σ, held for at least
 * EOG_MIN_DUR_MS = 12 ms, then one detection per REFRACTORY_S = 0.8 s, which is
 * how `_run_eog_sm` spaces them. σ is the 8.02 µV figure 9 just measured, so the
 * two figures are one continuous argument: 9 finds the noise floor, 10 spends it.
 *
 * What this stops short of is the glance PAIR. A single sustained crossing is a
 * spike, not a command — the game wants an opposite crossing within
 * GLANCE_WINDOW_S before it moves a paddle. That is a further step, and this
 * figure is about the threshold.
 *
 * The slider runs 1σ to 5σ and opens at 2.5σ. Those are historical: sigma_thr
 * has held five values in this repo — 6.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 6.0 — and 2.5 is the
 * one it was dropped to when 5σ turned out to be unreachable on noisy baselines.
 *
 * Red is the part of the trace that clears the line — the same red as the
 * threshold that selected it and as the count in the corner, because all three
 * are this step's output. Black is what went in. A reader needs to see WHICH
 * excursions counted, not just how many. */
